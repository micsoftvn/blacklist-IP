https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/drop.txt	When implemented at a network or ISP's 'core routers', DROP and EDROP will help protect the network's users from spamming, scanning, harvesting, DNS-hijacking and DDoS attacks originating on rogue netblocks.
https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/edrop.txt	
https://github.com/ktsaou/blocklist-ipsets/blob/master/bm_tor.ipset	Spamhaus strongly encourages the use of DROP and EDROP by tier-1s and backbones.
	
	Spamhaus DROP and EDROP are available in text format. Additionally, these lists (as well as the Spamhaus Botnet C&C list) are available by Spamhaus BGP Feed announced via an Autonomous System Number (ASN). Users can choose to peer with that ASN to null those prefixes as being ranges for which they do not wish to route traffic.
